/*
 * Z-index bands for the board's world layer. Items render in ONE stable pass (never split by
 * selection), so selecting one only changes its z-index - its React instance is preserved, so the
 * editing surface is never torn down (edits commit) and images don't reload. Paint order is decided
 * here by explicit z-index, not DOM order.
 *
 * For N non-connection items, ranked 0..N-1 by the scope-relative tree flatten (see `boardTree`):
 *   1 .. N        unselected item boxes (1 + rank)
 *   N + 1         the connection layer (lines + selected-line toolbar)
 *   N+2 .. 2N+1   selected item boxes (N + 2 + rank)
 *   2N + 2        the group toolbar                          - above everything
 *
 * The bands are disjoint by construction for any N, so a selected item ALWAYS sits above the
 * connection layer and above every unselected item, whatever the rank - it's bulletproof, not tuned.
 * Within a band the flatten order is preserved (via rank). A zone carries no special back layer: it
 * ranks like any item at its band floor, so its tint sits behind its OWN members (which the flatten
 * bands right above it), not universally behind everything.
