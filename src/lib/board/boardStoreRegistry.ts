/*
 * Module-level registry of board store instances, keyed by board id. Each entry is a
 * fully isolated `createBoardStore()` with its own command engine and undo stack, so N
 * board tabs give N independent undo stacks with no shared mutable state.
 *
 * Simpler than the character registry: there is no menu fallback (a board is shown
 * only when its tab is active) and no persistence handle (board item mutations persist
 * via commands; the viewport debounce-saves inside the store). Non-React callers reach
 * the active instance through `getActiveBoardStore()`; React callers resolve it through
 * `ActiveBoardStoreContext`. This is NOT a React module - no JSX, no hooks.
