 * of every character its elements reference, and here we turn that data into local characters and point
 * the elements at them. Dedup is by the PRESERVED character id (a globally-unique cuid, the same on
 * every machine): a character already in the drawer is LINKED (never duplicated, never overwritten); an
 * absent one is recreated keeping its id. The embedded portraits are already restored by importFromFile.
 */

 * Links or recreates the characters an imported board references, returning a map from each source
 * `characterId` to the LOCAL drawer item id backing it (for the element rewire). A character already in
 * the drawer is linked to its existing item; an absent one is created as a FULL_CHARACTER_SHEET drawer
 * item with its id kept. `ensureFolder` lazily makes (and memoizes) the shared "Imported from {board}"
 * landing folder - called only when a character is actually recreated, so pure links create no folder.
