/*
 * Board store - the React-facing, in-memory view of one open board, backed by the
 * normalized repository and a command/undo engine. It is a synthesis of two existing
 * stores: the per-instance factory shape of the character store (one store per open
 * board, hence one undo stack), and the command-engine wiring of the drawer store
 * (each mutation persists through a command, then the in-memory view resyncs).
 *
 * Item mutations persist inside their commands (each `do()` writes to the repository),
 * so there is no debounced item-save bridge. The only non-command persistence is the
 * viewport (camera state, debounce-saved on the board record) and hydration
 * (`loadBoard` on open). The store is the single owner of both.
