/**
 * Computes the `bottom` offset (a CSS `calc()` string) for a floating mobile
 * control, so every floating cluster clears the home-indicator safe area, clears
 * whatever bottom chrome sits beneath it, and is staggered far enough from any
 * other cluster on the same edge that the two never overlap in any configuration.
 *
 * The offset is `bottom-nav height + card-nav-bar height + base gap + stagger ×
 * stagger-step`, all in rem, plus `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` (the same inset
 * the `pb-safe` utility applies, made non-zero by the `viewport-fit=cover`
 * viewport). Callers describe their situation declaratively (which bottom chrome
 * is present, and their stagger index) rather than hard-coding `bottom-*`
 * values, so the whole floating layout stays consistent and safe-area-aware
 * from one place.
 *
 * Note: the drawer tab does NOT lift the FAB above its in-flow toolbar; the
 * drawer instead reserves a horizontal slot on its handedness-leading edge so
 * the FAB at its base offset sits inside the toolbar's vertical band, with no
 * button beneath it. The breadcrumbs (above the toolbar) are likewise clear.
 *
 * The two FAB-mode clusters that co-occupy an edge - the navigation FAB
 * (`stagger: 0`) and the toolbelt FAB (`stagger: 1`) - are kept apart by the
 * stagger; on the cards tab both also add the card-nav-bar clearance so they ride
 * above it together.
 *
 * @param config - Which bottom chrome is present, this control's stagger index, and any one-off clearance.
 * @returns A `calc(...)` string suitable for an inline `style={{ bottom }}`.
