 * The character sheet's ordered layout manifest: a flat list of references into `cards`/`journals`
 * that owns the render ORDER (the content arrays stay the normalized stores of record). One
 * reorderable space where cards and journals interleave.
 *
 * The invariant the type can't express: `sheetLayout` is a permutation-with-completeness over
 * `cards` + `journals` - every id appears exactly once, no orphans (an entry pointing at no live
 * card/journal), no dupes. The store keeps it that way by appending on add and splicing on remove;
 * `resolveSheetLayout` is the self-healing seatbelt that repairs any desync on read.
