 * are past the grace window. All triggers (startup, manual, periodic) funnel through
 * it; the periodic trigger first checks `isPeriodicSweepWarranted` so it only sweeps
 * under real pressure. This module is timer-free so it is directly unit-testable;
 * scheduling lives in the triggers (AppStartManager + useAssetGarbageCollection).
