 * - `migrationStatus`: the one-time legacy-blob migration status flag.
 * - `legacyBlobRetainedUntil`: marker that the legacy localStorage blob is still
 *   retained as a safety backup (dropped when the blob is finally removed).
 * - `migrationVerified`: `true` once the migration was proven faithful by
 *   reconstructing the Dexie tree at migration time and deep-comparing it to the
 *   source blob. Gates legacy-blob removal; absent means never offer removal.
 * - `migratedRecordCounts`: `{ folders, items }` written from the same faithful
 *   migration, for diagnostics.
 *
 * The `character*` keys mirror the drawer keys for the per-character migration:
 * `characterMigrationStatus`, `characterMigrationVerified`,
 * `characterMigratedRecordCount`, and `characterLegacyBlobRetainedUntil`. (The
 * active-character session pointer lives in localStorage, not here. See
 * `characterSession.ts`.)
