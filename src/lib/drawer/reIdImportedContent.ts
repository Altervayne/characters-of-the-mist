/*
 * Cross-reference-safe re-identification of imported drawer content. Importing a copy needs fresh ids so it
 * can't collide with existing rows, but a blind `deepReId` over a whole subtree breaks the cross-references
 * some content carries (a character's sheet-layout manifest + journal bookmarks, a board's connections + zone
 * membership, a journal's bookmark->page links). So each item is re-ID'd BY TYPE, exactly as the single-item
 * `addItem` / `addImportedItem` paths already do - this is the shared seam so the tree-import path can't drift
 * from them.
 */

 * Re-IDs one imported item's content according to its type:
 *   - FULL_BOARD / JOURNAL / NOTE keep their content verbatim (self-contained in the file; the id keys a
 *     focus-or-open round-trip, and reminting internals would orphan connections / bookmarks).
 *   - FULL_CHARACTER_SHEET routes through the aggregate re-id that keeps its manifest + bookmarks consistent.
 *   - everything else is a cross-ref-free card / tracker / post-it, deep-re-ID'd so the copy is independent.
