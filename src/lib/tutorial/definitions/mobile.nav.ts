/**
 * Mobile App Navigation. Where things live, rather than how to work them: the nav control itself, the three
 * destinations behind it (including the Sheet greying out with no character loaded), the toolbelt, and the
 * Settings hub. The Character Sheet lesson teaches operating the sheet; this one only points.
 * It runs on the REAL app - no demo - so every beat stands on the Menu, the Drawer or Settings, never on the
 * sheet: a user with no character of their own is redirected off it, and the Main Menu beat narrates Create
 * and Import rather than gating them, because those are real writes against the user's own workspace.
 * The mobile shell has two forms and they expose different controls, so the beats that differ carry a
 * `fabMode` override for the anchor, the copy, or the arrival, and the beats that work the ring carry a
 * `shell` that keeps them out of the bar entirely - one arc, branched only where the app is. The ring's pills
 * only exist while it is fanned out, which is why the ring is an arrival axis in that shell and not an axis
 * at all in the other.
 * Picking a destination closes the ring: that is the ring doing its job, not an obstacle, so the arc lets it
 * happen and then teaches it. Each destination gets a beat that says where the user has landed and hands off
 * to that surface's own lesson for the depth, and the user re-opens the ring themselves to move on. The ring
 * is never fanned out for them as a way past a gate - every arrival that opens it only re-establishes what
 * their own tap did a beat earlier, so back-navigation lands somewhere the next tap still means something.
 * Every gate is the user's own tap of the control the beat points at, watched as a `dom-event` on the resolved
 * anchor: the tap's outcome is the page's own nav state, whose store mirror is published a commit later than
 * the arrival that re-arms the gate - so a predicate reading it would still see the position the beat just
 * left and hand back a Next instead of arming. The tap is the signal; watch the tap.
 * Nav is driven through the serializable `mobileNav` bridge (the page owns its own local nav state).

 * The arrival descriptors that put the shell in `position`. Every beat names every axis it depends on:
 * arrival is the only hook that runs in both directions, so a beat that set up its state on the way forward
 * alone would strand the user on a surface where its anchor does not exist when they walk back into it. The
 * toolbelt and reorder mode are closed on every arrival - both hide or cover the nav control this tour is
 * about - and each verb is idempotent, so re-asserting an axis already held costs nothing.
