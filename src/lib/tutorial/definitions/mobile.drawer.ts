/**
 * Mobile Drawer. The library: what is in it, searching and filtering it, the two row shapes, folders, the
 * per-item menu, rearranging, and the toolbar along the bottom.
 * NOTHING here gates, and that is the shape of the surface rather than a shortcut. Every affordance the tour
 * covers is one of two kinds. The first is component-local: folder navigation, the search text, the rich /
 * compact switch and the per-item menu all live in the drawer's own state, which the nav bridge does not
 * reach - so a beat could not re-establish them on arrival, and a gate that cannot be re-armed strands the
 * user the moment they walk back into it. The second is a real write against the user's own library: every
 * item action and every toolbar action adds, loads, renames, moves, deletes, imports or exports something
 * they own. Those are described and never invited. What is left is narration, so the teaching rides on
 * accurate copy and the gesture cue - and the beats that describe an affordance stay `blocked`, which also
 * keeps the drawer's local state exactly where each arrival left it for the beats that follow.
 * Rearranging is the one exception, and the only place a user's own hands are let through: the demo library
 * routes its records AND its undo history, so a drag here cannot reach the real drawer. The copy has to be
 * exact, because the drawer's rows have no grip - the row itself is the target - and its sensor asks for a
 * 500ms hold rather than the card list's 150ms.
 * It reads a seeded demo library through a read-only overlay (a new user's real drawer is empty, which would
 * gut every beat). That overlay is not a tab, so arrival claims the drawer tab itself; nav is driven through
 * the serializable `mobileNav` bridge (the page owns its own local nav state).
 */

/**
 * The arrival descriptors that put the shell on the drawer. Every beat of this tour lives there and depends on
 * the same four axes, so every beat names all four: arrival is the only hook that runs in both directions, and
 * a beat that set up its surface on the way forward alone would strand the user when they walk back into it.
 * The toolbelt and the card-reorder mode are the sheet's, not the drawer's, but they cover the screen the
 * drawer needs, so they are closed here too. Each verb is idempotent, so re-asserting an axis already held
 * costs nothing.
