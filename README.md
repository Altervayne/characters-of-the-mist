# Campaigns of the Mist

**Campaigns of the Mist** is a fast, private, entirely client-side companion for running and playing [Mist Engine](https://cityofmist.co) tabletop RPGs: *Legend in the Mist*, *Metro: Otherscape*, and *City of Mist*. There's no server and no account: everything you make lives in your own browser, and it installs as an app that works fully offline.

It's an unofficial, fan-made project (a full rewrite of the old *Characters of the Mist* alpha, now rebranded as it grew from a character-sheet app into a whole table workspace). This README is for people who want to **run or hack on the code**. If you just want to *use* the app, it's at [campaignsofthemist.app](https://www.campaignsofthemist.app/) and it teaches itself through its built-in tutorials, so you won't find a feature list here.

## Running it locally

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **20.19+** (or **22.12+**), the minimum Vite 7 needs, and npm.

```bash
npm install      # install dependencies
npm run dev      # start the dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build        # typecheck + production bundle -> dist/  (runs `tsc -b && vite build`)
npm run preview      # serve the built dist/ locally
npm test             # run the test suite once (vitest run)
npm run test:watch   # run tests in watch mode
npm run lint         # eslint over the project
```

## Project structure

```
messages/                 Locale JSON -> en.json is the source of truth.
src/
  main.tsx, App.tsx        Entry point + app shell (theme/store providers, router).
  router.tsx               Routes (a single route into the character/workspace page).
  app/                     Global CSS + theme tokens.
  i18n/                    i18next config + the `locales.ts` registry of available languages.
  pages/                   CharacterSheetPage -> the one route; switches desktop/mobile shells.
  components/
    organisms/             The big surfaces: board, drawer, notes, tabs, navigator, cards, dialogs...
    molecules/ · ui/       Smaller pieces + the Radix/shadcn primitives.
    mobile/                The mobile shell (its own navigation, sheets, and screens).
    providers/             Theme + app-start context providers.
  hooks/                   Cross-cutting React hooks.
  lib/                     The non-UI core (see below).
```

`src/lib/` holds the domain logic and data layer, split by surface:

- **`stores/`** -> Zustand stores (drawer, app settings, general UI state…).
- **`character/`, `board/`, `notes/`, `drawer/`** -> per-surface domain logic + Dexie persistence.
- **`dice/`, `tutorial/`, `portals/`, `navigator/`, `theme/`, `cards/`, `challenge/`, `trackers/`** -> the feature subsystems.
- **`harmonization.ts`** -> the import migrator: brings exported files from older versions up to the current schema, so a file from any past release stays importable.
- **`backup/`, `assets/`, `types/`, `utils/`, `constants/`** -> full-app backup/restore, the image/asset store, shared types, and helpers.

A few architectural notes worth knowing before you dig in:

- **100% client-side.** No backend, no API. Everything persists to **IndexedDB via Dexie**; only a little app-settings state lives on `localStorage`.
- **Offline-first PWA.** The service worker (vite-plugin-pwa / Workbox) precaches the app so it runs with no network. Heavy surfaces (the board canvas, the CodeMirror notes editor) are code-split into lazy chunks that are *still* precached, so offline stays complete without bloating first paint.
- **Undo/redo** is a temporal Zustand layer (zundo), scoped per surface.
- **Localization** lives in `messages/*.json`, registered in `src/i18n/config.ts` and listed in `src/i18n/locales.ts`. `en.json` is the source of truth; the others are community-contributed.
